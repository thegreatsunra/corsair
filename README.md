1. Clone this repository (or download and unzip it) to begin a new jetfire project

### Now you're ready to use jetfire

1. Open your new jetfire project at the command line
1. Type `npm install && bower install` to install all dependencies
1. Type `grunt` to start your development server. jetfire will monitor the `/app` folder and refresh your browser whenever it detects changes
